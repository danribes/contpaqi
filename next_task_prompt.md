# Next Task Implementation Prompt

Let's go for the next task.

Please check the tasks.md file to find the last task implemented.

Write the test code for the next task not implemented yet and, once done that, write the code of that task making sure it passes the test you wrote before.

Run the tests, analyse the errors and fix them.

Write the following log files, making sure the files are named starting with T (capital T) and the task number in a three figures number (e.g. T065):

- **Implementation task log file** and save it in the `/log_files` folder under the name `TXXX_"name of the task"_Log`
- **Test_log file** and write it in the `/log_tests` folder under the name `TXXX_"name of the task"_TestLog`
- **Log_learn file** or didactic log file explaining what has been developed in the project, why and how. Save it in the `/log_learn` folder under the name of `TXXX_"name of the task"_Guide`

## Important Reminders

- This setup is containerized in Docker and there is no need to install the database or the Redis file.
- Don't forget to update the tasks.md file crossing the task you just completed once you're done with the tests, completed the log file and the learn file. Please add as well the implementation details.
- Don't forget to use Tailwind for all the CSS related code.
