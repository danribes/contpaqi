# Note: canvas is an optional dependency of pdfjs-dist that requires GTK/Cairo
# to compile. It's removed in the CI workflow after npm install to avoid
# build failures on Windows runners.
#
# Do NOT use omit=optional here as it breaks @rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc
# which is needed for Vite to build on Windows.
